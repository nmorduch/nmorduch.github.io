I designed this website while at Little Weaver Web Collective, for a startup presenting itself as a company bringing its field into the next era, as well as presenting a new product. The site needed to have a trustworthy modern feel while selling the product to buyers conservative about adopting new technologies. This design is easy to modify because it is composed of rearrangeable sections that can be used much like a slide deck to sell buyers and investors on the company and product.

This project was halted prior to build, so the image here presents the design without being identifiable to the client's branding.
