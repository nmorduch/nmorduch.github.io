I designed this website while at Little Weaver Web Collective for a startup presenting a new product and technology in a conservative field. We learned in interviews that the stakeholders wanted to position themselves as bringing their field into a new era, looking to companies like Apple and Tesla for branding inspiration. To this end, the marketing pages are composed of dynamic rearrangeable sections that can be used much like a slide deck to sell buyers and investors on the company and product. Potential users we talked with required a simpler trustworthy look, which inspired the simplicity of the inside pages.

The client was very happy with the design but had to halt the project due to financial difficulties. The images here present the design without being identifiable to the client's branding. Each of them links to a full-page mockup.
