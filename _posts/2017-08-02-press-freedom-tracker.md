I worked on this project as part of Little Weaver Web Collective. I was a large part of the research for this project, which involved bringing together a coalition of many stakeholder organizations and interviewing a number of different types of users. We learned in user interviews that journalists using this website to support articles they were writing would need strong sourcing of information as well complex filtering. We found that various stakeholders and users had different definition of who was a journalist, so we recommended that discussion of this project's definition included on the site.

The overall design was done by Harris Lapiroff with extensive feedback from me. I did a lot of work on the header and footer, especially with an eye to responsiveness and giving equal visual weight to the logos of each of the organizations.
