I worked on this project as part of Little Weaver Web Collective. I was a large part of the research for this project, which involved bringing together a coalition a many stakeholder organizations and interviewing a number of different types of users. The overall design was done by Harris Lapiroff with extensive feedback from me. I also designed on many small details, including having active fields and buttons in the filter be white so that one can quickly see on which criteria the incidents are being filtered.
