I worked on the research, development, and design of this project as part of Little Weaver Web Collective.

Research for this project involved bringing together a coalition of many stakeholder organizations and interviewing a number of different types of users. When interviewing potential users, we learned that the most important feature was filtering incidents by specific criteria to identify trends, and I laid out architecture for detailed tagging to aid that filtering. Journalists, a major user group, needed data to rigorously evaluates information, so I recommended prominent locations for source links, methodology explanations, and contact information. We also found that various stakeholders and users had different definitions of who was a journalist, so I recommended and provided information for the discussion of this project's definition that is included on the site.

For this design, I provided detailed requirements to another designer on my team and gave extensive feedback on the design. I also participated in the frontend development, working especially on responsiveness of the header and footer and on giving equal visual weight to the logos of each of the organizations.
