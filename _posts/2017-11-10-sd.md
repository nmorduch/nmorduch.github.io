I was the design lead on this project for Freedom of the Press Foundation while at Little Weaver, as well as having a large role in research interviews and synthesis. The layout of the homepage addresses conflicting goals of various audiences: The first thing on the page is a short description for people unfamiliar with the project; the first call-to-action serves to funnel away users who are looking for installation instructions; and the pink box serves to catch the attention of people with sensitive security needs before they show a lot of interest in the site.

A few of my favorite details of this site include that the logo lines up with the background hexagons at all screen sizes and that the hexagons indicating news category line up with the header logo.
