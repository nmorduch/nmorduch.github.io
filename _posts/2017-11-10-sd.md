I was design lead on this client project at Little Weaver as well as having a large part in the research process. A few of my favorite details include that the logo lines up with the background hexagons at all screen sizes and that the hexagons indicating news category line up with the header logo. Research involved learning about both the software and the extensive needs of the people who use it, and tailoring navigation to those needs.
