Poster inspired by [Bread and Puppet](http://breadandpuppet.org/)'s [resistance](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/8552/products/IMG_7383.jpg?3884) [posters](http://theyesmenfixtheworld.com/guide/images/thumb/Resistance.jpg/283px-Resistance.jpg). Everything black is letterpressed: the top is wood type, the middle is a linoleum block I carved, and the bottom is 18 point Garamond. Hand painted color on the daffodils. Run of about 20.
