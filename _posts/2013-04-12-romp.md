I designed all print materials for the 2013 Dandelion Romp, a contra dance festival held every year at Oberlin. using a drawing by [Anna Droege](http://annadroege.tumblr.com/). Pictured here are the poster advertising it, which was designed to be screen printed, and the T-shirt design. I also designed a schedule and name tags.
