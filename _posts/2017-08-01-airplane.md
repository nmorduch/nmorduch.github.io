We needed conference swag on short notice and I came up with the idea of a paper airplane. It was easy to get printed, easy to transport, and a fun piece of advertising. I chose the style of airplane because it is simple and flies pretty well. I designed the entire printout, including the folding instructions, and conducted hallway usability testing to make sure the instructions worked for a layperson.

Should you wish to print it to fold yourself, I have a [printable PDF](http://nmorduch.me/static/work/airplane.pdf).
