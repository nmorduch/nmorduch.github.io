I designed this website while at Little Weaver Web Collective, for an organization uniting college students to organize for food sourcing changes at their schools. The design needed to show the strength and vitality of its youthful organizing, while also positioning the organization as a trustworthy source of information for donors and food service administrators. The site needed to provide not only an overview of the organization, but also a collection of resources for student organizers, so I designed a visually appealing, scannable listing that is easily accessible from the navigation.
