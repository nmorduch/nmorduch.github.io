I code **detail-oriented** mobile-first **responsive designs** using HTML, SASS, and BEM.

I work with Django **templates**, Jekyll, Tumblr **themes**, and static HTML.

Experience in **print and 3D design** give me a broad range of ways of thinking about design.

I keep up with current standards, and choose **usability** over flashiness or minimalism.

I work well in a team, and care about writing and maintaining **readable code** to enable  collaboration.

I'm friendly and personable, and prioritize **client satisfaction**.
