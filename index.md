I've been working in [web design]({{ baseurl }}/work/web) for over six years. I design with the needs of users on all devices at the forefront of my mind. I keep up with current standards, and choose **usability** over flashiness or minimalism.

Experience in [print design]({{ baseurl }}/work/print) and woodworking give me a broad range of ways of thinking about design.

I code organized, **detail-oriented** HTML and CSS. I've worked with Django and Liquid templates, React, and static HTML, as well as with SASS, BEM and SMACSS.

I work well in a team, and care about writing and maintaining **readable code** to enable  collaboration. I'm friendly and personable, and prioritize **client satisfaction**.

Outside of work, I enjoy pottery, woodworking, cooking, and reading.
