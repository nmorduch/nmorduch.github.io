**I've always been drawn to form determined by function.**
As a [web]({{ baseurl }}/work/web) and [print]({{ baseurl }}/work/print) designer, I make research-informed decisions in order to develop usable products that balance the needs of stakeholders and users.
My ideal design is easy to use and goes unnoticed, with delightful details.

I cofounded [Little Weaver Web Collective](http://littleweaverweb.com), a web development agency, in 2014, and built it from 3 to 7 people in the first 2 years.

My time with Little Weaver has been invaluable for learning how to work with diverse stakeholders, balance multiple projects and priorities, and hire and onboard new staff, as well as for figuring out exactly what work I want to be doing.
I love fitting features into the puzzle of users' and stakeholders' needs, so in 2018 I've decided to seek a career focused on user experience so I can do just that.

I've been making things for as long as I can remember, and I find that my time spent on [woodworking]({{ baseurl }}/work/wood) and [pottery]({{ baseurl }}/work/clay) broadens my ways of thinking about usability and design. Investigating user needs is just as important with them, but concerns touching pieces rather than reading and pressing buttons.

I also enjoy cooking, reading, and the [outdoors]({{ baseurl }}/work/photo).
The first two involve interacting with design, while the latter affords the beauty of the undesigned natural world.

Technologies I use include Sketch, InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, HTML, CSS, Sass, and BEM, as well as Django and Liquid templates with a little dabbling in Python and Javascript to support my design work.
