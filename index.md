**I've always been drawn to form determined by function.**
As a [web]({{ baseurl }}/work/web) and [print]({{ baseurl }}/work/print) designer, I make research-informed decisions in order to develop usable products that balance the needs of stakeholders and users. My ideal design is so easy to use as to go unnoticed, with delightful details.

I cofounded [Little Weaver Web Collective](http://littleweaverweb.com), a web development agency, in 2014, and built it from 3 to 7 people in the first 2 years. My time with Little Weaver has been invaluable for learning how to work with diverse stakeholders, run a business, and collaborate with coworkers, as well as for figuring out exactly what work I want to be doing. I love fitting new features into the puzzle of people's needs and current branding, so in 2018 I've decided to seek a career with an established brand so I can do just that.

I've been making things for as long as I can remember, and I find that my time spent on [woodworking]({{ baseurl }}/work/wood) and [pottery]({{ baseurl }}/work/clay) broadens my ways of thinking about design. Rather than two-dimensional media for consuming and manipulating information, these are three-dimensional tools. I like to play with glazes and shaping the outside of my pots, but always leave the rims and insides smooth so that they can be used.

I also enjoy [cooking]({{ baseurl }}/2013/cooking), reading, and the [outdoors]({{ baseurl }}/work/photo). The first two involve interacting with design, while the latter affords the beauty of the undesigned natural world.

Technologies I use include Sketch, InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, HTML, CSS, SASS, and BEM, as well as Django and Liquid templates.
