		<p>I took the steel drum class in Oberlin&#39;s <a href="http://oberlinexco.org/">Experimental College</a>, which is taught by members of <a href="http://www.oberlin.edu/stuorg/osteel/">OSteel</a>, Oberlin&#39;s steel drum band. The theme of our concert was Pangaea, because their concerts always have theme that are plays on &quot;steel&quot; or &quot;pan&quot; (what each drum is called).</p>

<p>This was the first serious poster I designed to be machine printed. It was designed Illustrator, and required a hybrid kind of thinking between designing for display on a screen and design for silkscreened posters. I used a <a href="http://instagram.com/p/XNi6euFrdg/">photograph</a> by Toby Irving as a reference for the pan, and a Hubble <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110503.html">photograph from NASA&#39;s Astronomy Photo of the Day</a> for the background.</p>

<p>I made both an 11x17 color version and an 8.5x11 grayscale version of this poster, so that the large poster could be sent to the printer and people could print additional smaller posters on their own.</p>
