In the summer of 2012 I made a mockup of what will eventually be the Oberlin Video Portal. It was my first mobile-first design, and is currently stocked with images from [placekitten](http://placekitten.com/) and text from [Hipster Ipsum](http://hipsteripsum.me/). There are three pages to the mockup, accessible from header ("Search Results" and "Single Video"). Some of the links might also go to real Youtube videos. Maybe.
