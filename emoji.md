**I've always been ✏️ to form ⟸ function.**
As a [🕸]({{ baseurl }}/work/web) ➕ [🖨]({{ baseurl }}/work/print) designer, I make 🔭-informed decisions ➡️ 🔨 usable products that ⚖️ the needs of 🕴🕴 ➕ 👥.
My 🙌 🎨 is easy to use ➕ goes 🙈, with 😍 details.

I cofounded [🔬 🐥 🕸 Collective](http://littleweaverweb.com), a 🕸 📝 🏢, in 2014, ➕ 🔨 it from 👤👤👤 ➡️ 👤👤👤👤👤👤👤 in 🥇 2⃣ years.

My ⏱ with 🔬 🐥 has been invaluable for 🎓 how to work with diverse 🕴🕴, 🏃‍ a 🏢, ➕ collaborate with coworkers, as well as for figuring out exactly what work I 😍 to be doing.
I ❤️ fitting 🆕 features into the 🎮 of 👥's needs ➕ current branding, ➡️ in 2018 I've decided to 🔍 a career with an established brand ➡️ I 🥫 do just that.

I've been 🔨 things for as long as I can 🤔, ➕ I find that my ⏱ 💸 🔛 [🌳🔨]({{ baseurl }}/work/wood) ➕ [🥣]({{ baseurl }}/work/clay) broadens my ways of 💭 about 🎨.
🚫 ♭ 📰 for 🍽 ➕ 📊 ℹ️, these are 🔵 🛠.
I 👍 to ▶️ ➕ ⬢ the outside of my 🥣, but always leave the rims ➕ insides smooth so that they can be used.

I also ❤️ [🍳]({{ baseurl }}/work/print#cooking), 📖, ➕ [🏕]({{ baseurl }}/work/photo).
The 🥇 2⃣ involve interacting with 🎨, while the 3⃣ affords the ☀️ of the 🚫🎨 🌿 🌎.

🛠 I use ⊂ {💎, In🎨, 🖌, 📷🛒, HTML, CSS, Sass, BEM, 🐍 Django templates, 💧 templates}
