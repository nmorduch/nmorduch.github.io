**I have always been ✏️ to form ⟸ function.**
As a [🕸]({{ baseurl }}/work/web) ➕ [🖨]({{ baseurl }}/work/print) designer, I make 🔭-informed decisions ➡️ 🔨 usable products that ⚖️ the needs of stakeholders ➕ users.
My 🙌 design is easy to use ➕ goes 🙈, with 😍 details.

I cofounded [Little Weaver 🕸 Collective](http://littleweaverweb.com), a 🕸 development agency, in 2014, ➕ built it from 👤👤👤 ➡️ 👤👤👤👤👤👤👤 in the first 2⃣ years.

My ⏱ with Little Weaver has been invaluable for 🎓 how to work with diverse stakeholder, 🏃‍ a 🏢, ➕ collaborate with coworkers, as well as for figuring out exactly what work I 😍 to be doing.
I ❤️ fitting 🆕 features into the puzzle of users' needs ➕ current branding, ➡️ in 2018 I've decided to 🔍 a career with an established brand ➡️ I 🥫 do just that.

I have been 🔨 things for as long as I can remember, ➕ I find that my ⏱ spent 🔛 [🌳🔨]({{ baseurl }}/work/wood) ➕ [pottery]({{ baseurl }}/work/clay) broadens my ways of 💭 about usability and design. Investigating user needs is just as important with them, but concerns touching pieces rather than 📖 and pressing 🔘.


I also ❤️ [🍳]({{ baseurl }}/work/print#cooking), 📖, ➕ [🏕]({{ baseurl }}/work/photo).
The 🥇 2⃣ involve interacting with Design, while the 3⃣ affords the ☀️ of the undesigned 🌿 🌎.

🛠 I use ⊃ {💎, InDesign, Illustrator, 📷🛒, HTML, CSS, Sass, BEM, 🐍 Django templates, 💧 templates}
