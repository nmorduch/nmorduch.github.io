I got my start in woodworking in summer programs at the Eli Whitney Museum when I was five years old, and later worked there as an apprentice and camp counselor for six years. Along the way I took a few classes in fine woodworking and an internship with a professional furniture designer and woodworker.

I like the challenge of working with such a finicky medium as hardwood and I love being able to fill my own furniture needs.
