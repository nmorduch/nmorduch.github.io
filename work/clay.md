I make functional pieces that I use in my own kitchen. I like to use glazes that make interesting patterns with the way the change colors where they're thinner or where they overlap with other glazes. Sometime I shape the outside of my pieces, but to fulfill the goal of usability, I always leave the rims and insides smooth.
